# Comparing densities of mobile cell towers with population estimates

The relationship between official estimates of UK residential and workday population density and the density of mobile phone cell-towers is investigated using freely available and open-sourced data on cell-tower locations from [OpenCellID](http://opencellid.org/).  

## How do I use it?

### Requirements/Pre-requisites

R libaries required:
* Scrapy
* pymongo
* ggplot2
* ggmap


Python version: 2.7

### Project Structure

Repository structure:

* ``analysis`` folder contains the R files used for the analysis.
* ``reports`` contains the files generated by the report, subdivided in 3 directories: [part1](reports/part1), [part2](reports/part2), [part3](reports/part3).
    * ``.md`` files for easy to see code and output results
    * ``figures`` directories contains the generated figures for the publication
* ``execute.R`` is R script to be run from the repository folder to generate all the analysis and reports files
* ``data.Rdata`` data used in the analysis

### Data

The data used for this project were downloaded from the OpenCellID database on 16 January 2017.

A detailed description of the data is presented in the table below. For more details refer to the publication in the [Useful links section](#useful-links)

| Parameter | Description |
|:----------:|:-----------:|
| radio| Network type. One of the strings GSM, UMTS, LTE or CDMA.|
|mcc| Mobile Country Code (UK: 234, 235)|
|net| Mobile Network Code (MNC)|
|area|Location Area Code (LAC) for GSM and UMTS networks. Tracking Area Code (TAC) for LTE networks. Network IDenfitication number (NID) for CDMA networks |
|cell|Cell ID|
|unit| Primary Scrambling Code (PSC) for UMTS networks. Physical Cell ID (PCI) for LTE networks. An empty value for GSM and CDMA networks|
|lon|Longitude in degrees between -180.0 and 180.0 <br> If changeable=1: average of longitude values of all related measurements. <br> If changeable=0: exact GPS position of the cell tower|
|lat| Latitude in degrees between -90.0 and 90.0 <br> If changeable=1: average of latitude values of all related measurements. <br> If changeable=0: exact GPS position of the tower|
|range| Estimate of cell range, in meters.
|samples|Total number of measurements assigned to the cell tower
|changeable| Defines if coordinates of the cell tower are exact or approximate.|
|created| The first time when the cell tower was seen and added to the OpenCellID database.|
|updated|The last time when the cell tower was seen and update.|
|averageSignal| Average signal strength from all assigned measurements for the cell.|
